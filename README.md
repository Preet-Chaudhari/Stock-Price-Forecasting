# Stock-Price-Forecasting

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to forecast stock prices and optimize trading strategies by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Through analysis of historical stock data, we aim to develop predictive models that can anticipate future price movements and identify the most effective trading strategies.

## Key Features

### Data Preparation
- Utilization of daily percentage changes in stock prices to improve data interpretability and model performance.

### Feature Engineering
- Generation of over 97 features, including financial indicators and statistical measures, to provide comprehensive inputs for the predictive models.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Deployment of various machine learning models, including SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Decision Trees, and KNN, with rigorous training and validation to ensure accurate predictions.

### Ensemble Methods
- Application of ensemble techniques such as voting, blending, and Adaboosting to enhance model performance and prediction accuracy.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Historical stock data is collected and preprocessed to calculate daily percentage changes and organize them into distinct levels.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Innovative features are engineered to capture the nuances of stock market movements and provide comprehensive inputs for the predictive models.

3. **Model Development**: Several predictive models are trained and evaluated using various algorithms and ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**: Models are assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The AdaBoosting model exhibits superior performance in our tests.

## Results

The project successfully implements multiple machine learning models, with ensemble methods showing significant improvement in prediction accuracy. The AdaBoosting model emerges as a highly effective tool for forecasting stock prices, offering promising prospects for trading strategy optimization.
